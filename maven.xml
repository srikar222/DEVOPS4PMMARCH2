/Build tool?
Build tool compiles the source code and creates a software package which can be deployed on server.
Eg:java,dot net,python.

Different technologies have different build tools.
Java-Ant
     -Maven(Most popular)
     -Gradle(Upcoming)
.Net-NAnt

For applications in python and ruby:Node,Angular.


Maven(Build tool)
    Known for-Dependency management.
             -Build
             
             
com.xml
     Configuration file used by maven for building a project(without com.xml maven does not work).
     
     xml uses:-
     Storing configuration data.
     To exchange data b/w two applications.
     
 We can design our own xml according to our need.
 
 Dependency:-
 It is a jar file on which the project depends on. 
 Eg:servlet,hibernet,jpa.
 
 Plugins:More features.
 
 
 How maven manages dependencies?
 -Maintains repositories(Internet).
 -In repositories it stores jar files.
 -Maven downloads jar files from internet.
 
 
 Maven reposotories?
 
-Central.
-Remote.
-Local.

What does REpository have?
Collection of jar files.

Why we need Remote repository?
1.
  -Because of security reasons.
  -We can maintain our own repository in company.
2.
  -Team-1 is working on a project where Team-2 depends on.
    This can be done using remote repository.
3.
  Artifact.

Maven Build life cycle:-
Maven build does the following:
  -Validation.
  -Syntactical Errors.
  -Dependency Errors.

STEPS:
1.Validate-pom.xml.
2.Compile-SourceCode.
3.Test-Execute test Cases written by development.

Dev. writes code,he need to test.
   -Unit Testing.
   -Integration Testing.

What is Junit?
Framework using which we can Automate testing.
Framework used by java developers for automating unit testing.

4.Verify:-Integration test-Case.
5.Packaging(war/jar/var)[Create package].
6.Install (IN local repository).
7.Deploy (IN remote repository).

Maven Commands:
How to compile src code?
mvn compile [Step 2] Compiles Code.

mvn test [Step 3,4,5] Executes.
mvn package[Creates package].
mvn install[Step 1,2,3,4,5]  Package maintained in local repository.
mvn clean.
mvn deploy.

How to remove output folder?
mvn clean.

How to remove target directory?
mvn clean package.
mvn clean test package.
mvn clean install package.

Maven Transitive dependencies:-

                             |--->b.jar
      PROJECT---->.A.jar-----|
                             |---->c.jar
