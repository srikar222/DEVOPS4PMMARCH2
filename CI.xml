What is CI?
Set of developers push their changes to the SCM followed by
   -we run the build.
   -Perform quality checks.
   -Create package.
 This process is repeated often we call it continous integration.
 
 Why do we need CI in our projects?
 Using CI we can
             -Find out compile time errors in the code.
             -Find out Unit test cases & Integration test cases failure.
 These failures can be notified to the development team immediately.
 CI enables developers fix code fastly,quickly.
 
 
Explain CD?
After running CI package must be deployed on the server which enables testing team to test the code.
